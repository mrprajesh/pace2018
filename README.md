# PACE 2018
This is codebase for submission to PACE 2018 Challenge.

## Steiner Tree Problem

### Track 1
Public instance in track 1 is of low terminal instances where in we need output the exact optimum steiner tree.

### Track 2
In this track we need to solve the steiner tree problem using a tree decomposition of the graph.

### Track 3
This is solved based on an approximation algorithm or some heuristic algorithm based on the instances.
